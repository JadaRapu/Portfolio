## About
Hello! I'm Jada Rapu, a SEC+ certified aspiring data analyst with a background of four years as an intelligence analyst and two years as a cyber security specialist. I am currently obtaining a bachelors of science in Cyber Security, while being enrolled in various online courses where I have gained a solid foundation in tools such as Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Python. I am confident that my strong foundation and eagerness to learn will enable me to excel as a data analyst and make valuable contributions to any organization.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in cybersecurity / Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
